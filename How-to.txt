1. To open .dsn simulation files you need Proteus software which can be downloaded easily. (Just Google it Proteus 8.1 Download)

2. To use .hex file , burn it to the microcontroller by using a PICKIT-2 or PICKIT-3 program burner IC.

3. Use the PCBDesign.jpg to print the PCB on a copper board.

4. FinalCircuit.jpg can be used as a reference for the PCBDesign.jpg.

5. PIC16f887 datasheet has been uploaded for reference to the microcontroller used.
